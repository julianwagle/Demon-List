Angel List goes to extreme lenths to keep bots out. Most annoying of all - they change up all there html struncture and tag values every couple days. even if your bot is perfect, it will be useless shit in less than a week. I grew tired of the project after the third push in less than a week and open sourced it. If someone was to work on this with me I'd be more than happy to work on it with someone but its become a drain of a project for me with no pay off. Hope someone finds a use for this.
