Angel List goes to extreme lengths to keep bots out. 
Most annoying of all - they change up all their html struncture and tag values every couple days. 
Even if your bot is perfect, it will be useless shit in less than a week. 
I grew tired of the project after the third push in less than a week and open sourced it. 
If someone was to work on this with me I'd be more than happy to help but its become a drain of a project for me with no pay off. 
Hope someone finds a use for this.
